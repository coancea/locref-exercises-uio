# Optimizing Spatial Locality by Transposition on GPUs: Cuda Exercise 2

See section "Optimizing Spatial Locality by Transposition" in companion lecture slides.

The programming task refers to implementing the code of Cuda kernel `transKernel` in file `kernels.cu.h`, which works on the transposed versions of A and B, named `A_tr` and `B_tr`, respectively. Please search for keyword "Exercise" in file `kernels.cu.h` to find the implementation place.

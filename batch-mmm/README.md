# Batched Matrix Multiplication Under a Mask: Cuda Exercise 4

See section "L1$ and Register: Batch Matrix Multiplication under a Mask" in companion lecture slides.

The programming task refers to implementing the code of the Cuda kernel `bmmmTiledKer` in file `kernels.cu.h`. Please search for keyword "Exercise" in file `kernels.cu.h` to find the implementation place, and follow the instructions there. Remember to flatten the indices to all arrays hold in global memory.
